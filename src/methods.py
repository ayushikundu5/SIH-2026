Every method has the same signature - `f(noisy: np.ndarray, sr: int) -> np.ndarray`
returning audio of identical length - so evaluate.py can sweep all of them over
identical audio without special-casing. That uniformity is what makes the
comparison table trustworthy.

    RNNoise operates at 48 kHz in 480-sample (10 ms) frames; this project runs
    at 16 kHz, so we resample up with `soxr`, run the reference C library frame
    by frame through its low-level ctypes binding, then resample back down.
    Measured round trip (resample 16k->48k->16k on clean speech, no RNNoise in
    between): ~50.5 dB SNR - negligible next to what RNNoise itself does to the
    signal, so it does not confound the comparison.

    We call `pyrnnoise.rnnoise.process_mono_frame` directly rather than the
    package's higher-level `RNNoise.denoise_wav`/`denoise_chunk` wrappers: those
    are broken against the `audiolab` version pulled in by pip (`Reader` object
    has no attribute `rate`; `Graph.__init__() got an unexpected keyword
