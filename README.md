# Smart Noise Cancellation for Defence Communication

**Smart India Hackathon 2026 — Problem Statement 26052 — AI/ML workstream**

A streaming speech-enhancement model that strips gunfire, artillery, rotor and
engine noise off a soldier's outgoing microphone feed. 48,245 parameters, small
enough for an embedded chip, fast enough to run live.

---

## The problem

A soldier speaks into a microphone while a rifle fires beside him and an engine
roars underneath. The radio carries all of it and the listener cannot make out
the words.

Conventional noise suppression assumes the background holds still — estimate the
noise floor, subtract it. A gunshot breaks that assumption completely: it arrives
in microseconds, peaks far above the speech, and is gone before any noise tracker
adapts. We measured exactly that failure:

| Method | Gunfire removed (SI-SDR gain inside bursts) |
|---|---|
| Wiener filter | **+0.19 dB** — essentially nothing |
| Spectral subtraction | **+0.11 dB** — essentially nothing |
| GTCRN, off-the-shelf | +5.84 dB |
| **This project** | **+7.16 dB** |

Roughly **80% of gunshot noise energy removed, versus ~4% for classical filters.**

### Scope boundary

This repository is **Path 1 only**: the neural network that cleans the *outgoing
transmitted voice*. Earcup rumble cancellation, the DAC/driver chain, and the
analog limiter ahead of the ADC belong to the hardware team.

The model performs **suppression only — it does not apply gain.** Voice
amplification belongs to the analog path downstream.

**Contract with the hardware team:** 16 kHz mono in, 16 ms chunks, same out.

---

## For teammates: test this in 10 minutes and send feedback

You need **no dataset, no GPU and no PyTorch.** The models are in the repo and
run on ONNX Runtime.

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayushikundu5/SIH-2026.git
cd SIH-2026
pip install numpy soundfile soxr onnxruntime sounddevice
```

That is everything needed for steps 1–3 below. (PyTorch is only for retraining;
`faster-whisper jiwer` only for the automated word-scoring in step 4.)

### 1. Hear the showcase demo — 2 min

```bash
aplay results/demo60/before.wav
aplay results/demo60/after.wav
```

(`aplay` is ALSA and usually preinstalled; if it's missing or the file won't
play, use `paplay` (PulseAudio) or
`ffplay -nodisp -autoexit -loglevel quiet <file>` instead.)

Voice + engine + 10 gunshots, then the same clip cleaned. This is synthetic and
it is the model at its best.

### 2. Hear the honest test — 3 min, THIS is what we need judged

Real recording, real microphone, gunfire from a speaker in the room. All three
are level-matched, so judge **clarity, not loudness**:

```bash
labels=("UNPROCESSED - raw microphone" "MODEL, capped at -18 dB" "MODEL, full suppression")
files=("floor_none_unprocessed" "floor_18dB" "floor_full_model")
for i in "${!files[@]}"; do
  echo -e "\n${labels[$i]}"
  aplay "test-result/floors/${files[$i]}.wav"
done
```

The speaker reads the phonetic alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie…), digits 1–9 and
0, and a grid reference "four seven two nine".

**Write down what you can make out in each.** That is the feedback that matters.
Our automated scoring says the unprocessed version is the most intelligible and
the fully-suppressed version the least — we need human ears to confirm or refute
that, because a speech recogniser is not an ear.

### 3. Test it live on your own voice — 5 min

**Wear wired headphones.** Through speakers the mic hears the output and howls.
**Do not pick a Bluetooth headset as the input** — in call mode it destroys every
consonant before the model sees anything.

```bash
python -m src.stream_demo --list     # note your mic and headphone indices
python -m src.stream_demo --live --onnx artifacts/model_lowsnr_simple.onnx \
       --floor-db -18 --in-device 1 --out-device 4
```

Speak the phonetic alphabet. Play gunfire from your phone's speaker nearby. Then
run it again **without** `--floor-db -18` and compare. Ctrl+C to stop.

You will hear ~38 ms of delay on your own voice. That is the architecture, not a
bug.

### 4. Optional — score it automatically

```bash
pip install faster-whisper jiwer
python scripts/asr_score.py --model medium --inputs test-result/floors/floor_18dB.wav
```

First run downloads ~1.5 GB. Anything flagged `DECODER GLITCH` is not a
measurement — discard that row.

### What feedback is useful

1. **Which of the three clips in step 2 let you make out the most words?** Rank
   them. This is the single most valuable thing you can tell us.
2. Roughly how many of the 12 phonetic words did you get in each?
3. On the live test — is your own voice clearer with or without `--floor-db`?
4. Anything that failed to run, with the exact error.

There is also a formal scored test kit at `test-result/listening_test/` — an
answer sheet, a key, and scoring bands — if you have 15 minutes and someone who
has **not** seen the script.

### Known state, so you are not surprised

The model removes gunfire well (27.5 dB measured) and currently **costs
intelligibility** on real recordings. We are not asking you to confirm that it
works; we are asking you to tell us honestly how bad it is. See the status
section below and `RESUME.md`.

---

## Current status — read this before the results below

**The model suppresses gunfire well and does not yet deliver intelligible speech
on real recordings.** Both halves of that sentence are measured.

The results table further down is real, and it is measured on a *frozen synthetic
test set* using PESQ, STOI and SI-SDR — none of which measures whether a listener
can make out the words. When word recognition was measured directly on real
recordings made with a real microphone and real gunfire, the picture reversed.

Word recognition, scored by a speech recogniser over 26 known tokens
(`scripts/asr_score.py`, whisper-medium):

| recording | input SNR | unprocessed | model + floor −18 dB | model, full depth |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| take 1 | +8 dB | **85%** | 73% | 12% |
| take 2 | −12 dB | **50%** | 4% | 4% |
| take 3 | −5.9 dB | **85%** | 77% | 69% |

Doing nothing wins on all three, and the more the model suppresses the fewer
words survive. On the same recording the model removes **27.5 dB** of gunfire —
the suppression is not in doubt; the speech does not survive it.

Two caveats, both real:

- **A recogniser is not an ear.** ASR is far more robust to additive noise than
  humans and far *less* robust to processing artefacts. Enhancement hurting ASR
  while helping people is a known effect. What makes this credible anyway is that
  the person who made the recordings independently reported the same thing.
- **A scored human listening test has not been run.** The kit is ready at
  `test-result/listening_test/`. It needs three people who have not seen the
  script.

`RESUME.md` has the full picture and the prioritised plan.

## Results

Measured on a **frozen 720-clip test set** — held-out speakers, held-out noise
recordings, held-out rooms — plus the standard VoiceBank-DEMAND benchmark.

### Per noise category (PESQ, whole clip)

| Method | Gunshot | Artillery | Rotor | Engine | Siren | Babble | Overall |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Ours (shipped)** | **1.901** | **1.722** | **1.995** | **2.066** | **2.080** | **1.833** | **1.933** |
| GTCRN pretrained (DNS3) | 1.793 | 1.628 | 1.868 | 1.967 | 1.934 | 1.702 | 1.815 |
| Wiener filter | 1.316 | 1.205 | 1.404 | 1.422 | 1.408 | 1.374 | 1.355 |
| Spectral subtraction | 1.303 | 1.197 | 1.372 | 1.395 | 1.375 | 1.352 | 1.332 |
| Unprocessed | 1.297 | 1.188 | 1.354 | 1.380 | 1.364 | 1.333 | 1.319 |
| GTCRN VoiceBank-tuned | 1.311 | 1.210 | 1.354 | 1.357 | 1.351 | 1.320 | 1.317 |

Note the last row: the checkpoint that **wins** on VoiceBank-DEMAND (PESQ 2.868
there, better than DNS3's 2.508) is statistically indistinguishable from doing
nothing here. The model that handles café noise best is the worst at gunfire —
the clearest possible argument for domain-specific training.

### Targets, by input-SNR band

Achievable gain is bounded by how much noise was present to begin with —
measured correlation between input SNR and SNR gain is **−0.78**. A single
average is therefore misleading in both directions, so results are stratified.

| Input SNR | Clips | Unprocessed | Ours | PESQ > 2.5 | STOI (ours) | STOI > 0.85 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| < 0 dB | 170 | 1.098 | 1.378 | No | 0.733 | No |
| 0 – 5 dB | 232 | 1.176 | 1.723 | No | 0.852 | **Yes** |
| 5 – 10 dB | 169 | 1.357 | 2.099 | No | 0.911 | **Yes** |
| > 10 dB | 149 | 1.752 | **2.706** | **Yes** | 0.957 | **Yes** |

### Speed and latency

| Stage | ms |
|---|---|
| Chunk buffering (hop) | 16.00 |
| Overlap-add delay (**measured**, = `win − hop`) | 16.00 |
| Model compute (p95, 1 thread) | 6.01 |
| **Total** | **38.01** |

**RTF 0.2955** (target < 0.5) — passes comfortably.
**Latency 38.01 ms** against a 32 ms target — **does not pass, and cannot.**
See [Known limitations](#known-limitations).

### Is the measurement trustworthy?

The same evaluator was run over the standard VoiceBank-DEMAND test set, where
published numbers exist to check against:

| | Ours, measured | Published |
|---|---|---|
| Unprocessed PESQ | **1.968** | 1.97 |
| Unprocessed STOI | **0.921** | 0.921 |

The pipeline reproduces the published baseline exactly, which independently
verifies the resampling chain, the ITU-T P.862 PESQ build, the STFT framing and
the inference path. Every other number here rests on that calibration.

---

## For teammates — start here

There are two very different levels of setup. Pick the one you need.

### Level 1 — run and demo the model (5 minutes, no dataset)

**You do not need the 64 GB of audio, and you do not need PyTorch.** The trained
model is committed to this repo and runs on ONNX Runtime. This is enough to hear
it work, demo it, and run it on your own recordings.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayushikundu5/SIH-2026.git
cd SIH-2026

# any Python 3.9-3.12; no GPU, no PyTorch
pip install numpy soundfile soxr onnxruntime sounddevice pyyaml

# listen to the 60-second demo that is already in the repo
cd results/demo60
aplay before.wav
aplay after.wav
```

Then run it on your own audio, or live from your microphone:

```bash
python -m src.stream_demo --file yourfile.wav --onnx artifacts/model_simple.onnx
python -m src.stream_demo --live      # WEAR HEADPHONES or it feeds back
```

### Level 2 — retrain or re-evaluate (hours, needs the dataset)

Only needed if you are changing the model or regenerating results. See
[Full setup from scratch](#full-setup-from-scratch) and
[Reproducing everything](#reproducing-everything).

**Use the same paths as the original machine and nothing needs editing:**

```
.venv                          the virtualenv, at the repo root
~/SIH26052_data/raw            downloaded corpora
~/SIH26052_data/prepared       16 kHz conversions
~/SIH26052_data/testset        frozen evaluation set
```

If you use different paths, edit the three lines that reference them in
`configs/data.yaml` (`raw`, `prepared`, `testset`); the venv path is picked up
by `run.sh` via `$SIH_PY` (defaults to `.venv/bin/python`), so point that
environment variable elsewhere instead of editing the script.

Downloads total **~32 GB** and take several hours. They are resumable — re-run
the same script if interrupted, and it continues rather than restarting.

---

## Quick start — test it yourself

The shipped model runs through **ONNX Runtime only**. No GPU, no PyTorch needed.

### 1. Listen to the 60-second demo

```bash
cd results/demo60
aplay before.wav      # voice + engine + 10 gunshots
aplay after.wav       # same clip, cleaned
```

Gunshots occur at **20.4, 25.5, 29.9, 32.9, 35.2, 39.6, 44.4, 48.3, 53.4, 56.0 s**.
The clearest improvements are at 25 s, 33 s and 35 s. Use headphones.

Measured on that clip: PESQ **1.40 → 2.19**, STOI **0.91 → 0.95**,
SI-SDR **6.3 → 13.0 dB**.

### 2. Run it on your own audio

```bash
PY=.venv/bin/python

# current best: low-SNR model with the suppression cap
$PY -m src.stream_demo --file path/to/your.wav \
    --onnx artifacts/model_lowsnr_simple.onnx --floor-db -18
# writes results/demo/before.wav and results/demo/after.wav

# the original shipped model, for comparison
$PY -m src.stream_demo --file path/to/your.wav --onnx artifacts/model_simple.onnx
```

See [Testing it live](#testing-it-live-from-your-microphone) for full device
setup and what to listen for.

### 3. Live microphone

```bash
$PY -m src.stream_demo --list     # list audio devices
$PY -m src.stream_demo --live     # speak, clap, bang the desk; Ctrl+C to stop
```

**Wear headphones** or the microphone will pick up the speakers and feed back.
This runs the real streaming contract — one 16 ms frame per callback, caches
carried forward — so it is the same code path the hardware team will run.

### 4. Regenerate the demo

```bash
$PY scripts/make_demo.py             # rebuilds results/demo60/ from held-out data
```

---

## Where to hear everything

Every audio file in the repo, what it demonstrates, and how to play it.
All the `test-result/` clips are **level-matched to −20 dBFS**, so you are
comparing clarity and not volume.

Play any file with:

```bash
aplay ~/SIH-2026/<path>
```
or `xdg-open <path>` to open it in your default player.

### 1. The showcase demo — 60 s, synthetic, this is the one for a slide deck

`results/demo60/`

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `before.wav` | voice + engine noise + 10 gunshots |
| `after.wav` | the same clip through the shipped streaming model |
| `reference_clean.wav` | the ground-truth speech, for comparison |
| `demo_metrics.json` | the measured numbers for this clip |

Gunshots at **20.4, 25.5, 29.9, 32.9, 35.2, 39.6, 44.4, 48.3, 53.4, 56.0 s**.
Measured: PESQ **1.40 → 2.19**, STOI **0.91 → 0.95**, SI-SDR **6.3 → 13.0 dB**.
Built from held-out test material and processed through the **shipped ONNX**, one
16 ms frame at a time — not an offline approximation that happens to sound good.

```bash
cd ~/SIH-2026
for f in before after reference_clean; do
  echo -e "\n$f"
  aplay "results/demo60/$f.wav"
done
```

### 2. Real recordings — the honest test

`test-result/voice/` — made with a phone, gunfire from a speaker in the room.

| file | what | input SNR |
|---|---|---|
| `voice_dry.wav` | voice only, phone **video** capture | — |
| `voice_dry3.wav` | voice only, phone **voice-recorder** app | — |
| `voice_noisy.wav` | take 1, voice + gunfire | +8 dB |
| `voice_noisy2.wav` | take 2, gunfire much louder | −12 dB |
| `voice_noisy3.wav` | take 3 | −5.9 dB |
| `noise_bed3.wav` | 5.6 s of gunfire alone, extracted from take 3 |  |

**Compare `voice_dry.wav` against `voice_dry3.wav`.** Same speaker, same script,
same phone — one recorded with the camera app, one with the voice recorder. The
camera app's own noise suppression scooped **19.2 dB out of the 1–2 kHz formant
region**. This is why the capture chain is documented so heavily in `RESUME.md`.

### 3. The suppression-depth comparison — the central tradeoff

`test-result/floors/` (take 3), `test-result/final_take1/`, `test-result/final_take2/`

| file | suppression | word score (take 3) |
|---|---|---|
| `floor_none_unprocessed.wav` | 0.0 dB | 85% |
| `floor_12dB.wav` | 10.5 dB | — |
| `floor_18dB.wav` | 15.1 dB | 77% |
| `floor_24dB.wav` | 19.2 dB | — |
| `floor_full_model.wav` | 27.5 dB | 69% |

```bash
cd ~/SIH-2026
labels=("unprocessed" "floor -18 dB" "full model")
files=("floor_none_unprocessed" "floor_18dB" "floor_full_model")
for i in "${!files[@]}"; do
  echo -e "\n${labels[$i]}"
  aplay "test-result/floors/${files[$i]}.wav"
done
```

Listen for whether you can write down the phonetic alphabet, not for whether the
gunfire is gone — it will be, in all of them.

### 4. Operating envelope — where it breaks

`test-result/envelope2/` — clean speech mixed with real gunfire at known SNRs,
with real PESQ/STOI against the clean reference. Files named
`m<muffle>_snr<SNR>_{before,after}.wav`, e.g. `m8_snr5_after.wav`.

```bash
cd ~/SIH-2026
for s in 15 10 5 0 m5; do
  echo -e "\n=== SNR $s dB ==="
  aplay "test-result/envelope2/m8_snr${s}_after.wav"
done
```

> **Not every folder below is committed.** The source recordings in
> `test-result/voice/`, the floor-sweep comparison, the per-take finals and the
> listening kit are in the repo, because the results table rests on them. The
> intermediate variants — `envelope/`, `envelope2/`, `clarity/`, `candidates/`,
> `demo3/`, `demo_noisy2/`, `snr_sweep/`, `repaired/`, `bandwidth_demo/`,
> `live_check/` — are gitignored (~110 MB) and regenerate from the committed
> source audio plus the scripts. Re-create any of them with
> `scripts/floor_sweep.py`, `scripts/robustness_sweep.py` or
> `scripts/snr_sweep.py`.

### 5. Negative results — kept so nobody rebuilds them

`test-result/clarity/`, `test-result/candidates/`, `test-result/demo3/`

These sound plausible and measure worse. See "Negative results" in `RESUME.md`
before drawing any conclusion from them.

### 6. The listening-test kit

`test-result/listening_test/` — `TEST_A.wav`, a blank `ANSWER_SHEET.txt`, and
`KEY_tester_only.txt`. Three listeners who have **not** seen the script, one
play-through each, no replays. 26 items. This is still the missing measurement.

---

## Testing it live from your microphone

The live path runs the real streaming contract — one 16 ms frame per callback,
caches carried forward — so it is the same code the hardware team will run.

### Before you start

- **Wear wired headphones for the output.** Through a speaker, the mic hears the
  processed audio and you get a feedback loop.
- **Do not select a Bluetooth headset as the INPUT.** In call mode it collapses
  to narrowband (30 dB down by 1312 Hz) and destroys every consonant before the
  model sees anything. Use the laptop's built-in mic array or a wired mic.
- Play gunfire from a **separate speaker**, placed away from the laptop, so the
  microphone genuinely hears it.
- Expect **~38 ms of delay** on your own voice. That is the architecture, not a
  fault — see [Known limitations](#known-limitations).

### List your devices

```bash
PY=.venv/bin/python
$PY -m src.stream_demo --list
```

Note the index of your microphone (input) and your headphones (output).

### Run it

```bash
# A - current best: low-SNR model with the suppression cap
$PY -m src.stream_demo --live --onnx artifacts/model_lowsnr_simple.onnx \
    --floor-db -18 --in-device 1 --out-device 4

# B - same model, no cap: maximum suppression, fewest words
$PY -m src.stream_demo --live --onnx artifacts/model_lowsnr_simple.onnx \
    --in-device 1 --out-device 4

# C - the original shipped model, for comparison
$PY -m src.stream_demo --live --onnx artifacts/model_simple.onnx \
    --in-device 1 --out-device 4
```

Ctrl+C to stop. An input level meter prints as it runs. Substitute your own
device indices from `--list`.

**What to listen for:** speak the phonetic alphabet — Alpha, Bravo, Charlie… —
and see whether your own consonants survive. Comparing A against B is the whole
tradeoff in one test.

### Run it on a file instead

```bash
$PY -m src.stream_demo --file yourfile.wav --onnx artifacts/model_lowsnr_simple.onnx \
    --floor-db -18 --out-dir results/demo
# writes results/demo/before.wav and after.wav

# then score the words - no listeners needed
$PY scripts/asr_score.py --model medium --inputs results/demo/before.wav results/demo/after.wav
```

Input must be **16 kHz mono WAV**. Expect `RTF ≈ 0.29`.

---

## Full setup from scratch

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Python 3.12 — NOT 3.14. PyTorch ships CPU-only wheels for 3.14, so on 3.14 the
# GPU sits idle and training is roughly 50x slower with no error message.
sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv
# if your distro's repos don't have python3.12:
# sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa && sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv

# Virtualenv, at the repo root (matches run.sh's default $SIH_PY)
python3.12 -m venv .venv
PY=.venv/bin/python

# PyTorch with CUDA. Only needed for TRAINING and EXPORT — not for running the model.
$PY -m pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126

$PY -m pip install numpy scipy soundfile soxr librosa pystoi onnx onnxruntime \
                    onnxscript onnxsim einops sounddevice pyyaml tqdm matplotlib \
                    pandas pytest
# or simply: $PY -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Verify CUDA: `$PY -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"` → must print `True`.

### PESQ needs a C compiler

`pesq` is the ITU-T P.862 reference implementation and builds from source; it
builds cleanly against gcc with nothing beyond `build-essential`:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
$PY -m pip install pesq
```

### Vendored upstream code

`third_party/gtcrn` holds the streaming-conversion code from
[Xiaobin-Rong/gtcrn](https://github.com/Xiaobin-Rong/gtcrn) (MIT), which
`src/export_onnx.py` imports. The model itself is vendored at
`src/models/gtcrn.py` with its licence alongside.

---

## Reproducing everything

Datasets live at `~/SIH26052_data` — **~64 GB**, deliberately outside the repo.
They are fully reproducible from the scripts here.

```bash
bash scripts/download_tier1.sh          # LibriSpeech, MUSAN, RIRs, ESC-50   (~24 GB)
bash scripts/download_transients.sh     # firearm corpus, UrbanSound8K       (~8 GB)
```

VoiceBank-DEMAND needs the content-validating fetcher, because
`datashare.ed.ac.uk` answers HEAD with a ~4 KB HTML interstitial and a
size-based check will happily declare a 10%-downloaded file complete:

```bash
bash scripts/fetch_zip_until_valid.sh \
  "https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10283/2791/clean_testset_wav.zip" \
  ~/SIH26052_data/raw/vbd_clean_testset.zip
bash scripts/fetch_zip_until_valid.sh \
  "https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10283/2791/noisy_testset_wav.zip" \
  ~/SIH26052_data/raw/vbd_noisy_testset.zip
```

Then the whole pipeline — resumable, skips completed work, aborts rather than
running a later stage on bad inputs:

```bash
bash scripts/auto_pipeline.sh
```

Or stage by stage:

```bash
./run.sh status      # what is downloaded / built so far
./run.sh data        # extract + resample + manifests + mixture QA
./run.sh testset     # freeze evaluation set + VoiceBank-DEMAND benchmark
./run.sh baseline    # comparison table — RUN BEFORE TRAINING
./run.sh train       # fine-tune (~2.2 h on an RTX 3050)
./run.sh ablate      # identical run, transient loss term disabled
./run.sh finish      # evaluate + bench + export + handoff bundle
./run.sh test        # unit tests
```

---

## Testing

### Unit tests — 19 invariants

Two of them exercise the PyTorch STFT and **skip with a clear reason** when
PyTorch is unavailable, so the suite still reports on a machine set up for
inference only:

```
19 passed                   # full environment
17 passed, 2 skipped        # PyTorch absent or blocked
```

Those two tests were previously **broken rather than skipping** - the module
bound `S` to `src.framing`, which is NumPy-only and has no `stft`/`istft`, while
they called `S.stft`. They raised `AttributeError` whenever PyTorch was present.
Fixed; the suite now genuinely reports `19 passed`.

```bash
PY=.venv/bin/python

$PY -m pytest tests -q                                              # all

```

These pin down the things that **fail silently** rather than raising: STFT
round-trip exactness, transient-mask/frame alignment, that the mixer actually
achieves the SNR it was asked for, that the limiter stays monotonic and bounded,
and that SI-SDR is genuinely scale-invariant.

### Fast end-to-end checks (each under a minute)

```bash
# data → loss → backward, with real data; catches shape/device/NaN problems
$PY scripts/smoke_train.py --steps 20 --batch 24 --workers 8

# the full trainer, two tiny epochs — exercises scheduler, validation, checkpointing
$PY -m src.train --tag smoke --epochs 2 --epoch-size 480 --val-size 96

# render mixtures AND check them (mask coverage + burst prominence)
$PY scripts/qa_mixtures.py --n 24

# evaluate a few methods on a subset
$PY -m src.evaluate --methods unprocessed wiener gtcrn_dns3 --limit 40

# latency + RTF — run on an IDLE machine, background load inflates it
$PY -m src.bench --onnx artifacts/model_simple.onnx

# verify the shipped ONNX still matches the offline model
$PY -m src.export_onnx --ckpt checkpoints/shipped_best.pt --out artifacts/model.onnx
```

### Evaluating a specific checkpoint

```bash
$PY -m src.evaluate --methods "gtcrn:checkpoints/shipped_best.pt" --tag mine
$PY -m src.evaluate --testset ~/SIH26052_data/voicebank_demand \
    --methods unprocessed gtcrn_vctk --tag vbd
```

Method names accepted: `unprocessed`, `wiener`, `specsub`, `noisereduce`,
`gtcrn_dns3`, `gtcrn_vctk`, or `gtcrn:<path-to-checkpoint>`.

## Datasets

| Purpose | Dataset | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| Clean speech | LibriSpeech `train-clean-100` / `dev-clean` / `test-clean` | CC BY 4.0 |
| Steady noise | MUSAN (noise, music, speech-for-babble) | CC BY 4.0 |
| Room acoustics | OpenSLR-28 impulse responses | Apache 2.0 |
| **Gunfire** | Zenodo 7004819 — 4 firearms × 3 firing styles, outdoor range, AFRL-affiliated | **CC BY 4.0** |
| Transients | UrbanSound8K (`gun_shot`, siren, engine) | CC BY-NC 4.0 |
| Transients | ESC-50 (helicopter, fireworks, thunderstorm, engine, siren) | CC BY-NC 3.0 |
| Benchmark | VoiceBank-DEMAND test set | see record EULA |

The firearm corpus ships **ground-truth gunshot timestamps** — 6,212 annotated
shots across 2,148 clips — so bursts are cut at the real acoustic event rather
than wherever an energy detector guesses.

> **ESC-50 has no `gun_shot` class.** It offers `fireworks` and `thunderstorm` as
> transient proxies only. Real firearm audio comes from Zenodo 7004819 and
> UrbanSound8K.

Pool sizes after splitting (train / val / test, disjoint by recording):

| Pool | Train | Val | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| Speech (LibriSpeech) | 27,269 | 1,940 | 1,850 |
| Gunshot | 2,165 | 132 | 265 |
| Engine | 2,617 | 188 | 315 |
| Siren | 1,122 | 41 | 275 |
| Babble | 362 | 21 | 43 |
| Artillery | 66 | 4 | 10 |
| Rotor | 72 | 2 | 6 |
| Room impulse responses | 51,112 | 3,101 | 6,005 |

## How it works

```
download_*.sh      → raw corpora (resumable; these hosts drop long transfers)
prepare_data.py    → extract, resample ONLY what needs it
build_manifests.py → splits + disjointness ASSERTIONS → manifests/manifest.json
qa_mixtures.py     → render mixtures and CHECK them
make_testset.py    → frozen evaluation set, written once
src/evaluate.py    → comparison table  (BEFORE training)
src/train.py       → fine-tune
src/bench.py       → latency + RTF
src/export_onnx.py → streaming ONNX + faithfulness check
make_handoff.py    → the bundle the hardware team receives
make_report.py     → assembles results/REPORT.md from measured files only
```

### The mixer is the centre of gravity

Mixtures are built in **two distinct layers**, and that distinction is the whole
project:

- **Steady background** (MUSAN) at a global SNR measured over *active-speech
  frames only* — whole-clip SNR is skewed by silence, so two clips nominally at
  "0 dB" sound quite different.
- **Impulsive bursts** (gunfire, explosions) placed at random offsets as discrete
  events, cut at their acoustic onset, scaled by **peak** level, and routinely
  louder than the speech.

Blending gunfire evenly through a clip instead of injecting discrete bursts
teaches only the easy stationary case, and the model then fails on exactly the
sound the problem statement cares about.

The mixer also models the **analog limiter** the hardware team places before the
ADC (soft-knee, threshold 0.6–0.95), because that is the signal the model
actually receives in the field.

### Burst-local metrics

Gunfire occupies 12–20% of a clip. A whole-clip score is dominated by the
remainder, so a model that removes *none* of the gunfire can still post a
respectable number. `metrics.masked_metrics` measures **inside the bursts** — the
column that answers the question actually being asked.

### Splits are disjoint by RECORDING, and asserted

`build_manifests.py` **raises** on overlap rather than warning. This matters more
than it sounds: the firearm corpus ships each shot as up to 8 per-channel files
plus a channel-mean file sharing one `uuid`, so a naive per-file split would leak
the same physical gunshot into train and test eightfold.

## What the hardware team receives

Everything in `artifacts/`:

- **`model.onnx`** — 390 KB, weights folded inline, verified self-contained by
  loading it from an empty scratch directory
- **`model_lowsnr_simple.onnx`** — the newer model trained on deployment-matched
  SNR. 390 KB, streaming fidelity verified at **max abs diff 1.05e-06**. Pair it
  with `--floor-db -18`; see the status section for why depth is a dial and not
  something to maximise
- **`SPEC.md`** — sample rate, chunk size, cache shapes, latency breakdown, opset
- **`example_inference.py`** — minimal streaming loop
- **`results.md` / `results.csv`** — the measurements
- **`passthrough_stub.onnx`** — a Day-1 identity model with the real interface, so
  hardware integration could be built and tested while training ran

The model is **stateful and streaming**: one 16 ms frame per call, with three
cache tensors fed back in.

| Input | Shape |
|---|---|
| `mix` | `(1, 257, 1, 2)` — STFT of one frame, real/imag |
| `conv_cache` | `(2, 1, 16, 16, 33)` |
| `tra_cache` | `(2, 3, 1, 1, 16)` |
| `inter_cache` | `(2, 1, 33, 16)` |

Initialise all caches to zeros; feed the outputs back on the next call.

Streaming fidelity was verified frame-by-frame against the offline model:
**max absolute difference 3.99e-07**.

## Known limitations

Stated plainly, because a results table that hides these is worth less than one
that admits them.

1. **The 32 ms latency target cannot be met** with GTCRN's 512/256 framing.
   16 ms of chunk buffering plus a *measured* 16 ms overlap-add delay is 32 ms
   before a single multiply; the total is 38.01 ms. No faster processor fixes
   this. The fix is 320/160 framing (20 ms window, ~21 ms total) and a retrain.

2. **The transient-weighted loss term was tested and dropped.** It was built as
   the structural answer to "gunshots still get through", but a paired ablation
   over the same 720 clips showed **no benefit where it was supposed to help**
   (+0.05 dB on gunshot bursts, p = 0.72) and a small but **significant cost** to
   overall quality (PESQ −0.027, p < 0.001). The shipped model is the version
   *without* it. The improvement over the pretrained baseline is real
   (+1.38 dB on gunshot, p = 0.0004) but comes from **the training data, not the
   objective**. The code retains `--w-transient` so the experiment is repeatable.

3. **`SNR gain > 15 dB` is not well-posed on its own** (measured correlation with
   input SNR: −0.78). Reported by band instead.

4. **Gunfire suppression is uneven.** The +7 dB figure is an average; individual
   shots range from clearly removed to barely attenuated. This is "substantially
   reduces gunfire", not "removes it".

5. **Artillery and rotor rest on thin evidence** — 66 and 72 distinct source
   recordings, against 2,165 for gunshot and 2,617 for engine.
   `scripts/download_fsd50k_eval.sh` fills the gap but implies a retrain.

6. **Drone/quadcopter audio is poorly covered** by open corpora. Helicopter is
   well represented; drones are not.

7. **ESC-50 and UrbanSound8K are CC BY-NC.** Fine for research and competition;
   must be replaced with CC-BY sources before procurement. The firearm corpus is
   already CC BY 4.0.

8. **PyTorch exports at opset 18** regardless of the requested version — confirm
   your runtime supports it before any TensorRT/Jetson port.
